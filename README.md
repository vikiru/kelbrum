**Kelbrum** is an anime recommendation system designed to suggest anime titles similar to those chosen by users. It employs **K-means++** clustering with a custom distance function, which uses a combination of the **Manhattan** and **Dice** distance. The custom distance function assigns weighted values to each property of an anime such as its `type`, `genres`, `score` to compute the distance between two separate anime.

The frontend of the project was initially set up using [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) for development purposes, but has since transitioned to utilize [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), in conjunction with [React](https://react.dev/), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).

The backend of this project, aka the 'heart' of the project was built utilizing [Tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/) in combination with external libraries such as [ml-kmeans](https://github.com/mljs/kmeans), [ml-distance](https://github.com/mljs/distance), and [simple-statistics](https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics). Additionally, to perform TF-IDF analysis on anime synopses, [natural](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural) was used alongside [remove-stopwords](https://github.com/WorldBrain/remove-stopwords), [word-list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/word-list), and [lemmatizer](https://github.com/FinNLP/lemmatizer).

Upon combining these two parts, the project comes together in the form, that is, **Kelbrum**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The data used within this project was possible thanks to the following:
>
> 1. [Original Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dbdmobile/myanimelist-dataset) - The anime dataset was read and processed into a custom JavaScript class known as [AnimeEntry](./recommender/models/AnimeEntry.js).
> 2. [JikanAPI](https://github.com/jikan-me/jikan-rest) - Missing information such as `pageURL`, `imageURL`, `trailerURL` and other existing properties which may have needed updates were updated by making several API requests to JikanAPI, which contains anime information obtained from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/).

## üåü Features

-   The ability to search for any anime within the existing dataset via a search bar
-   A homepage featuring a hero section that encourages users to search for an anime and displays 10 anime randomly selected that meet a minimum average score, providing users with immediate recommendations
-   The ability to view all anime grouped together based on properties such as `genres`, `studios`, `seasons`, etc
-   The ability to view the top 100 anime within the existing set of anime, based on average score
-   A dedicated anime details page that enables users to view detailed information about an anime and receive recommendations based on similarity
-   The ability to view 10 unique random anime recommendations and view up to 200 recommendations per anime (not all anime will have that many recommendations)
-   The ability to grow and accommodate other content types such as `manga`, `manhwa`, and `manhua`
-   The capability to prioritize anime properties based on assigned weights and adjust the recommendation algorithm at any time using the provided K-means JSON file and feature tensors
