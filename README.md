<h2 align="center"> Kelbrum </h2>

**Kelbrum** is an anime recommendation engine designed to suggest anime titles that are similar to those chosen by users. It employs K-means++ clustering in combination with a custom distance function, which uses Gower's distance. The custom distance function assigns weighted values to each property of an anime such as its `title`, `genres`, `score` to accurately compute the distance between two seperate anime.

This project was bootstraped using [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/), along with [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [React](https://react.dev/), and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The data used within this project was possible thanks to the following:
>
> 1. [Original Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dbdmobile/myanimelist-dataset) - The anime dataset was read and proccessed into a custom JavaScript class known as [AnimeEntry](./reccomender/models/AnimeEntry.js).
> 2. [JikanAPI](https://github.com/jikan-me/jikan-rest) - Missing information such as `pageURL`, `imageURL`, `trailerURL` and other existing properties which may have needed updates were updated by making several API requests to JikanAPI, which contains anime information obtained from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/).
